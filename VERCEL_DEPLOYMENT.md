### 4. Git Branch Setup

Ensure you have the following branches in your repository:
- `main` (for production)
- `preview` (for preview/staging)
- `development` (for development)

## Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployments

With the configuration in place, Vercel will automatically deploy:
- Production environment when you push to the `main` branch
- Preview environment when you push to the `preview` branch
- Development environment when you push to the `development` branch

### Manual Deployments

You can also trigger manual deployments from the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click "Deploy" and select the branch you want to deploy

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, you can access your environments at:
- Production: `https://pdflexo.yourdomain.com`
- Preview: `https://preview-pdflexo.yourdomain.com`
- Development: `https://dev-pdflexo.yourdomain.com`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your deployment:

1. Check the build logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Verify that your environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure your domain DNS settings are properly configured
4. Check that the `vercel.json` file is correctly formatted
